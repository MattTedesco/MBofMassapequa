    <h2>Engine & Performance</h2>
    The A-Class Sedan will be available as an A 220 and as an A 220 4MATIC, both equipped with a 2.0L inline-4 turbocharged engine that produces 188 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 7G-DCT dual-clutch transmission.
    
    Equipment & Appointments: KEYLESS-GO® with HANDS-FREE ACCESS Available
    
    The standard equipment for the A 220 and A 220 4MATIC is extensive and includes the revolutionary MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience multimedia system with touchscreen) with Voice Control. As with every Mercedes-Benz, safety is also a top priority, so sophisticated safety systems including Active Brake Assist and adaptive braking technology with Hill Start Assist and the HOLD function are standard. In addition, the A-Class Sedan can be customized with unique design and equipment lines including Progressive (standard) and the optional AMG Line. A Night Package is also available as an option.
    
    KEYLESS-GO with HANDS-FREE ACCESS will also be one of the available options. The HANDS-FREE ACCESS function conveniently enables the hands-free and fully automatic opening of the trunk lid with a kicking motion of the foot under the rear bumper.

    <h2>Design: Superior Sportiness and Modernity</h2>
    The A-Class Sedan seamlessly embodies the design idiom of Sensual Purity with its purist design that emphasizes distinct yet harmonious surfaces. Clear, formal shapes emphasize surface areas with reduced lines and precise gaps.
    
    The new A-Class Sedan has the proportions of a dynamic and compact sedan with short front and rear overhangs. The deep greenhouse and compact rear-end contribute to the vehicle’s dynamic boost. The 17 to 19-inch wheels and pronounced wheel arches give the A-Class Sedan a sporty stance on the road.
    
    The design of the front-end looks very progressive. This impression is enhanced by the low, elongated hood, the chrome slim-line headlamps, the torch-like daytime driving lights, the optional single-louvre diamond radiator grille with chrome pins and, of course, the central star.
    
    A precisely characterized line runs along the muscular and sensual shoulder to emphasize the perfectly contoured side volume, while the side mirrors sit on the beltline.
    
    The two-part taillamps emphasize the width of the rear end. The rear reflectors were relocated to the modular two-part rear bumper. Depending on the selected equipment, the rear bumper is available with a black diffuser or with a chrome trim strip and chrome tailpipe tips.

    <h2>Passive Safety</h2>
    Highly Stable Passenger Compartment and Modern Restraint Systems
    
    The new A-Class is also the first Mercedes-Benz model to be developed at the new Technology Centre for Vehicle Safety (TFS). The design of the vehicle structures incorporates findings from research into real accidents. Every single body shell component was developed according to loads and stresses encountered, with respect to geometry, material thickness, joining technology and material quality (increased proportion of high-strength and ultra-high- strength sheet steel).
    
    The centerpiece of the body's safety concept is the highly rigid passenger compartment. A greater use of high-strength, ultra-high-strength and press- hardened sheet steel results in an impressive rigidity when subjected to accident-induced stress – for example, in frontal, lateral or rear-end collisions and roll-overs.
    
    The driver and front passenger seats each have a three-point seat belt with a  belt force limiter and belt tensioner. As standard, the new A-Class is equipped with driver and front passenger airbags, a driver's knee airbag and window airbags. Unlike in many competing models, the window airbags cover the A- pillar for more complete passenger protection. Thorax-pelvis side airbags are also standard in the front and available as an optional addition for the rear.

    <h2>Intelligent Drive</h2>
    Functions from the S-Class
    
    The A-Class is optionally available with the very latest driver assistance systems with functions adopted from the S-Class. For the first time, the A-Class is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain conditions. To do this, it keeps a close eye on the traffic situation with improved camera and radar systems that allow it to see more than 1,500 feet ahead (up to 500 meters). The A-Class also uses map and navigation data for certain assistance functions. For example, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC® is able to provide route-based support to the driver in numerous situations and predictively adjust the speed when approaching bends, junctions or roundabouts. Active Emergency Stop Assist and the intuitive Active Lane Change Assist are also included as part of the Driver Assistance Package.
    
    Active Brake Assist is standard for the new A-Class. Depending on the situation, it can help to effectively mitigate or avoid the consequences of rear-end collisions with slower-moving, stopping, or stationary vehicles ahead. The system can even recognize crossing pedestrians and cyclists and can intervene or support the driver in possible collision scenarios.
    
    Active Lane Keeping Assist can warn the driver by means of pulsed vibrations in the steering wheel when the vehicle is unintentionally drifting out of its lane at speeds between approximately 37 and 125 mph. If the vehicle passes over a solid line, it can pull the vehicle back into the lane by applying the brakes on one side. In the case of a dotted line, such intervention takes place only when there is a danger of collision with a vehicle in the adjacent lane (including danger from oncoming traffic).

    <p>The family of compact cars from Mercedes-Benz continues to grow: the all-new A-Class Sedan will launch early next year. The four-door sedan has a wheelbase of 107.4 inches and the proportions of a dynamic and simultaneously compact sedan with short front and rear overhangs and boasts impressive space in the interior. In addition, the sedan model has A- Class virtues familiar to the rest of the world. These include a new and efficient engine and high levels of safety thanks to the available state-of-the- art driving assistance systems on par with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The new A-Class is also the first vehicle in the Mercedes-Benz lineup to introduce the intuitively operated MBUX – Mercedes-Benz User Experience multimedia system. The all-new 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Sedan will celebrate its World Premiere in Brooklyn, NY in July 2018 and will go on sale in the U.S. in early 2019.
    
    “Following the successful start of the A-Class, things at Mercedes-Benz are happening in quick succession with regard to the new family of compacts. In response to the wish of many customers, we now offer the A-Class for the first time as a sedan,” says Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing and Sales. “Anyone looking for a compact, sporty sedan with a separate trunk now has a new, attractive alternative. It will attract new customers for Mercedes-Benz.”
    
    The new generation of compacts has made a key contribution to the rejuvenation and image-change of the Mercedes-Benz brand. The launch of the four-door CLA Coupe in 2013 was the first time a compact car from Mercedes- Benz was sold in the U.S. market. In 2017, nearly one in two buyers of a Mercedes-Benz compact car in the U.S. had previously driven a competitor vehicle, and more than 50-percent of the CLA customers were new to Mercedes-Benz (first-time buyers and conquests
    
    The 1997 A-Class originally established the compact car segment of Mercedes- Benz that exists today. Since then, more than six million models have been delivered worldwide. As the seventh model, the A-Class Sedan further expands the range of Mercedes-Benz compact cars. A logical addition, because with the C, E and S-Class, Mercedes-Benz continues to hold its position as a top- manufacturer of premium sedans.
    
    The A-Class Sedan offers great utility with roomy shoulder, elbow and headroom and easy access to the rear. The improvement to rear headroom space is particularly exceptional and the trunk was designed for practical usability with a large trunk opening that allows for comfortable loading and unloading of larger luggage items.</p></div>

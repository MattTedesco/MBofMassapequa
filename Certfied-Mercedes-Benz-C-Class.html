        <h2>More Powerful, More Efficient Engine</h2>
        The 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class will also benefit from a new 2.0-liter inline-4 turbo engine that produces 255 hp (vs. 241 previously) and 273 lb-ft of torque, an increase in 14 hp. The Sedan is also equipped with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission that affords a dynamic driving experience.
        
        The C-Class Sedan is produced at four plants on four continents, including the lead plant in Bremen (Germany), East London (South Africa), Tuscaloosa (USA) and Beijing (China). The facelifted 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Sedan will celebrate its World Premiere at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show and will go on sale in the U.S. by late 2018.

        <h2>Intelligent Drive</h2>
        State-of-the-Art Active Safety
        
        The updated C-Class features the latest driver assistance systems available in the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, offering the driver cooperative support and providing for a higher standard of active safety than its predecessor. The C-Class is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations. To do this, it keeps a close eye on the traffic situation; improved camera and radar systems allow it to see up to 1,640 feet ahead. The vehicle's surroundings are scanned by radar across a distance of up to 820 feet to the front, 130 feet to the sides, and 260 feet to the rear, while with the camera a range of up to 1,640 feet is possible to the front, including 295 feet in 3D. The C-Class also uses map and navigation data for assistance functions. For example, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC (as part of the Driver Assistance package) is able to support the driver in numerous situations on the basis of map information and predictively adjust the speed, for example when approaching bends, junctions or roundabouts. Other new developments include the intuitive Active Lane Change Assist and Active Emergency Stop Assist as functions of Active Steering Assist.
        
        The redesigned C-Class comes with extended Active Brake Assist as standard. Depending on the situation, this can help to mitigate the consequences of rear-end collisions with slow-moving, stopping or stationary vehicles ahead. This function operates even with crossing pedestrians and cyclists or prevents collisions altogether.

        <h2>The Multimedia Systems</h2>
        Customized Information and Music Offerings
        
        The C-Class comes standard with a multimedia system featuring two USB ports, an SD card reader, Bluetooth connection and media interface
        
        The latest-generation COMAND® Online system (optional) boasts fast 3D hard-disc navigation with topographic map display, photo-realistic 3D buildings, and 3D map rotations. Comprehensive information is displayed on the navigation map. For example, in addition to real-time traffic density information, it can include Car-to-X Communication warning messages, the weather, filling stations including current fuel prices, and free parking spaces.
        
        With the Concierge service (available as a subscription service), MercedesMe Connect customers have a host of individual services at their disposal: from making restaurant reservations and obtaining tips about tourist routes, to gathering information on cultural or sporting events and sending navigation destinations directly to the vehicle.
        
        Mobile devices corresponding to the Qi standard can be charged conveniently while on the move with the optional NFC wireless charging system. The charging surface in the quick storage tray at the front of the center console is also suitable for large smartphones.
        
        The C-Class Sedan is equipped with a FrontBass® 5-speaker Audio System as standard and with the Burmester® Premium Sound System available as an option.
